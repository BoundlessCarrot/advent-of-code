# Advent of Code

I'm putting as much of the 2023 advent as I can. Zig and Haskell are the languages that seem interesting currently, so that's what I'll be using.

## Structure
The repo is structured by years -> days. Each solution (regardless of the language) will be in that day's folder.

## My Progress (trees!)
